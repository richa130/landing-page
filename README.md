HEADER:
- Started off with the nav bar. Used flexbox to space the logo/links. Made the right margin of the logo auto, which takes up all the available space. Initially used two empty divs to make the empty space on either side, but that quickly became really confusing with a lot of nested divs/elements. Then I realized I could just change the left and right padding to get that empty space (duh!). 
- For the rest of the header, I used some nested flexboxes. One for the content on the left + the image, and then one for the content itself with the direction set to column. 

INFORMATION
- This section was very similar to one of the flex exercises. All of the images/text were put in a flexbox and justified to the center with some gap. Each image/text was in its own flexbox as well, with a direction of column, to make the text appear below the image.
