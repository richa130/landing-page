HEADER:
- Started off with the nav bar. Used flexbox to space the logo/links. Made the right margin of the logo auto, which takes up all the available space. Initially used two empty divs to make the empty space on either side, but that quickly became really confusing with a lot of nested divs/elements. Then I realized I could just change the left and right padding to get that empty space (duh!).
